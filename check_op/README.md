# ONE PIECE (MANGA) RELEASE SCHEDULE CHECKER

The main function of uploded script is to check release schedule for current week.   
_including chapter number, official and scan release dates._

**Repo includes** : a bash script file and pup (executable) html parser used in the script   
**Dependencies** : bash, curl, sed and pup

_you can also get pup using **go**_ [refer here](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup)

**NOTE**   
+ After downloading pup, include its location in your PATH variable.
+ Or you can place it anywhere and edit `PUP` variable in the script to include its location.
+ Included script is not user interactive by any means.
+ It's just a simple implementation that I wrote to practise my scripting skills.
+ It has many other benefits like making it run automaticallly and updating the status with any kind of notification.
